# dls_ldap_query

Format lists of users by querying LDAP

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install dls-ldap-query`
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/dls-ldap-query:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/dls-ldap-query/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from dls_ldap_query import __version__

print(f"Hello dls_ldap_query {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m dls_ldap_query --version
```
